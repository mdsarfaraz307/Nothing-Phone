        <p>Carl Pei, the former OnePlus CEO, made a comeback in the global market with his own brand Nothing. Recently, we got our hands on the Nothing Phone (1), which is the brand’s first phone to reach the masses. It is basically a 5G smartphone that is heavily inspired by Apple iPhones in a lot of aspects. The smartphone packs a Snapdragon processor along with an AMOLED display and a dual rear camera system.</p>
   <br>
   <p>One thing which differentiates the phone from all the alternatives available on the market is the Glyph interface and the transparent body. There is doubt in saying that Nothing Phone (1) is an experiment which has led all of us to see something new and unconventional. However, in this review, we will find out if these aspects work as strengths or the weakness of the Nothing Phone (1).</p>

                        <p>The design of the Nothing Phone (1) can be said to be the one aspect which grabbed the attention of the audience all over the globe. Same was the case with me, as soon as I pulled the phone out of the box, it took me a couple of minutes to just explore the design and how different elements have been used. However, if you have a keen interest in iPhones you’ll find that the design of the Nothing device has a striking resemblance to that of the iPhone 12.</p>
                
                     <p>The rear panel of the device is completely transparent and it also has the Glyph interface integration. At the top left corner of the device, it has two sensors and the bottom left. The power button of the device is placed at the right spine and the volume rockers at the left spine. To offer it an eye-pleasing look, Nothing has hidden the mechanical parts of the phone pretty neatly. Another major highlight of the device is that you will love the fact that the phone is not prone to smudges. And if you spot one, it can be removed easily.</p>

                            <p>Apart from that, I specifically covered an article in which multiple users have reported design flaws in their Nothing Phone (1). Though I got a bit lucky in that case as my device has none of them. But still, it seems like a major problem when encountering design flaws at a point where someone is investing an amount of more than 30,000.</p>
                       <p>At the rear panel, Nothing Phone (1) also has 900 white LEDs configured to work as notification lights. The feature is being dubbed by Nothing as the Glyph interface. The LED lights of the device cover the physical aspects like the camera module and the wireless charging cable. The reaction of the Glyph interface to ringtones, battery charging indicator, Google Assistant, etc, is completely customizable.</p>

                        <p>Nevertheless, on a personal note, I think that the smartphone could have been better if there were more changeable options in respect of the Glyph interface. Still, I am happy to know the fact that the Glyph interface of the handset is going to get better with every update as claimed by the company.</p>
                   <p>While these LED lights at the back look interesting but company failed to mention anything about their life cycle during the launch. Since these are regular tiny LED lights, we don’t know what will happen if some of them stop working, will they be replaced by Nothing for Nothing?</p>

                        <p>While using the phone, I figured out that it has two display settings including Standard, which is more or less the average setting and the Alive mode. Not only this but the colour temperature of the phone can also be controlled accordingly. While streaming videos and playing games, I witnessed that the colour composition was perfectly breathtaking. If you are someone who is worried about power consumption, then the dynamic refresh rate is a boon for you. The feature was working pretty efficiently at the time of testing.</p>

                <p>Well, here comes the big question, should you buy the Nothing Phone (1) or not? So, if you are someone who loves exploring new features (and is already fantasized about the Glyph interface) then you can surely go for the smartphone. Moreover, it is the Eperfect device for those who want decent performance with praiseworthy camera capability.</p>
                   <p>However, if you are someone who is into performance completely is takes overpricing to the chin, then the smartphone is not for you. On an honest note, I found the device a bit overpriced, especially after the fact that the charger will be sold separately. On a concluding note, keep it in mind that this is the first smartphone from the brand and still people are facing issues like design flaws and others. So make sure that you think thoroughly before investing a decent amount.</p>
